# RegiRitjes
Self-hosted "Ritten registratie" app. Instead of spending your hard-earned cash to keep track of the amount of kilometres you've ridden, why not host and install it yourself for "free"?

Suitable for self-employed commuters/freelancers.

## Info
This repo contains the code to host your own back-end and the code to compile your own .APK to install on your phone.
